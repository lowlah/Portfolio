## Udacity Project: Portfolio Site
This is my Portfolio website project for udacity. Live version can be found here : https://lowlah.github.io/Portfolio/.

Flexbox layout was used. Hamburger menu code implemented was from the udacity lesson on hamburger menus. The navigation menu links (e.g ABOUT), will be updated as the course goes on. Presently does not navigate anywhere.  A placeholder image from https://imgplaceholder.com/ was used.
